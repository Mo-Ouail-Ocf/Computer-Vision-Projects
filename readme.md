# AI Projects: Computer Vision

Welcome to my repository of personal AI projects! Here, I share the work I'm doing in the field of Computer Vision (CV).

## Contents

### Computer Vision Projects

- These projects cover a wide range of topics in computer vision.
- I experiment with techniques such as object detection, classification, generative models, and visual question answering.
- The projects include implementations of:
  - Object Detection and Classification
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Visual Question Answering (VQA)
  - And many more

### Tasks to Do

- Add an index to organize different projects and techniques.

## How to Run the Code

### On Local Machine

If you have a CUDA-powered machine and want to run the projects locally, follow these steps:

#### Windows

```batch
conda env create -f environment.yml -n cv_projects_env
conda activate cv_projects_env
```

### Notice

- Make sure you have Conda installed.
- The projects are compatible with Python 3.11.
