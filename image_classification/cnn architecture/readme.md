# CNN Architecture on cat-and-dog dataset :

- You can get the dataset on **[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog)**

- Model was trained in Lightning AI

- Code split into 3 files : data , model & main to organise & make code modular

- I used pytorch ignite in order to monitor & evaluate training using the well desgined event system
